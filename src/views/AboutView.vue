      <div class="title">The Goal</div>
      <div class="desc">The aim of this application was to simplify and enhance stock analysis through an improved user interface. During development, we encountered several challenges, particularly with data availability, as free-tier APIs offer limited access. This constraint prevented us from providing the depth of data initially envisioned, such as <strong>comprehensive fundamental analysis</strong>, <strong>detailed company information</strong>, <strong>competitor comparisons</strong>, <strong>recent search history</strong>, and <strong>additional technical indicators</strong>. Certain options, such as <strong>country selection</strong>, <strong>stock exchange preferences</strong>, and <strong>technical indicator filters</strong>, are restricted and cannot be adjusted due to <strong>API call limitations</strong>. These constraints arise from the free-tier API's rate limits and available data, preventing us from offering full flexibility in these areas. Looking ahead, we plan to integrate stock <strong>prediction and recommendation features using AI/ML</strong> to further enhance the applicationâ€™s capabilities.</div>

      <div class="desc">This application is based on <strong>Vue3</strong> with <strong>vuex store management</strong> to manage the data. The UI/UX of the application was done using <strong></strong> Figma. The graph visualization is done with the help of <strong>D3.js</strong> based library called <strong>observablehq/plot</strong>.</div>

      <div class="title">Backend flow</div>
      <div class="desc">The backend, built with <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express</strong>, integrates <strong>Alpha Vantage</strong> endpoints via <strong>RapidAPI</strong>. <strong>Redis</strong> caches historical stock data for a day to reduce response times, ensuring faster performance for frequently browsed stocks. <strong>MongoDB</strong> stores persistent company details, optimizing repeated queries by minimizing redundant API calls. This setup enhances efficiency by leveraging Redis for short-term caching and MongoDB for long-term storage of static company information.</div>
